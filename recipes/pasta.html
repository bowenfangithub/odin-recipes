    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>One of the secrets to perfect Italian pasta is to finish cooking
         the pasta in the sauce. If you master and understand this dish,
          you will understand the art of Italian pastas and pasta sauces
           which is all about putting very simple ingredients together in
            just the right way. Try using my Fresh Garden Tomato Sauce (see Notes).</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 ounces guanciale</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>4 ounces rigatoni pasta</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons dry white wine</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups fresh tomato sauce</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>kosher salt to taste</li>
        <li>1 1/2 ounces finely grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut guanciale into 1-inch by 1/8-inch strips.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil over medium heat in a saucepan. Add guanciale and cook 
            until well browned and fully rendered, 5 to 7 minutes. Turn off the
             heat and use a slotted spoon to transfer it to a bowl. Leave all fat 
             in the pan.</li>
        <li>Start pasta: Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. 
            Cook rigatoni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until not 
            quite done, about 10 minutes. You want it undercooked by at least 1 to
             1 1/2 minutes.</li>
        <li>At the same time, add wine to the guanciale fat in the saucepan. Place
             over medium-high heat and cook for about 1 minute. Stir in tomato sauce
              and pepper; bring to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Transfer the almost fully-cooked pasta into the sauce using a slotted spoon;
             it's okay if some water gets in the sauce. Add guanciale and stir to combine.
              Season with salt. Cook and stir until pasta absorbs the sauce and finishes
               cooking, and the sauce thickens up, about 3 minutes. If the sauce gets too
                thick, add a splash of the pasta water.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat and add some of the Pecorino cheese. Stir until melted, then 
            repeat until all cheese has been added.</li>
        <li>Ladle into 2 bowls and serve.</li>
    </ol>
